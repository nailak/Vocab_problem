PROJECT NAME: Surf the NYT with Quora!1) Team member names:Naila AlKhalawi, Qianqian Zhao, Suhani N Mehta2) Team member responsibilities:Each of us primarily handled one aspect of the project. Naila was responsible for communicating with NYTimes, Qianqian was responsible for building the extension and fetching tags from Quora, and Suhani was responsible for CSS and layout structure.However, we all helped each other in their work and participated in problem solving throughout the project duration.3) Project Description:The Chrome extension is basically meant for Quora users to look for news relevant to a particular post they might be reading.When someone is in on a page in Quora and clicks on our extension, we pull the tags from the page and list them in the pop-up window. For each tag, we search NYTimes for articles that have the tag word in them. The articles are searched with ÒclosestÓ relevance as the highest priority and displayed chronologically.  The author name is also shown for each of the articles. User can switch between tag words and look up for any news articles that contain the tag word. By using these tags that have controlled vocabularies, we are able to tackle the fact that there are many ways to describe things. As such,  the articles we pull from the NYT are more relevant to the Quora page. 4) Technologies used:Chrome Extension, HTML, CSS, Jquery, JSON, Github5) URL of the repository on github:https://github.com/nailak/Vocab_problem.git6) Live URL of where it's hosted:The package must be loaded in Chrome (tools> extensions> load unpacked extension)7) Known bugs:None known
